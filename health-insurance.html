                                        <div>Health insurance is an agreement wherein an insurance company agrees to
                                            compensate the insured for the medical and surgical expenses incurred during
                                            the policy tenure. The medical expenses may incur if the insured falls ill,
                                            or meets an accident that leads to hospitalisation of the insured. To be
                                            eligible to avail coverage benefits under the policy, the policyholder is
                                            required to pay a specific amount periodically, known as premium. Health
                                            insurance premium is decided by an insurance company and policyholders are
                                            required to pay the same on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly
                                            basis, without any lapse, to avoid losing the renewal benefits.</div>

                                            <p>Claim under a health insurance policy can be made in two ways - in a
                                                cashless manner and in a reimbursement manner. A cashless claim is when
                                                you receive treatment at a network hospital of the insurance provider
                                                who is servicing your policy. If the claim request is accepted, the
                                                insurance company directly settles the bills at the hospital.
                                                Whereas in reimbursement claims, you are required to pay for the
                                                hospital bill from your own pocket first, and make a claim request with
                                                the insurance company later. The insurance company will process your
                                                claim and reimburse you for the same after accepting the claim. You can
                                                make a health insurance claim by following the simple steps given below:

The insurance companies determine premiums after considering various factors that are explained below:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Type of Insurance Plan:</strong> Your health insurance premium is based on the type of plan you choose. If you choose a critical illness insurance plan, then the premium will be high. If you choose an individual health insurance policy, then the premium will be different from that of a family floater plan. To know the difference in health insurance premiums, you can use InsuranceDekho&rsquo;s health insurance premium calculator. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Age of the Insured:</strong> With age, you become more prone to health issues and are more likely to make health insurance claims. Therefore, you are required to pay higher premiums if you buy health insurance plans in later stages of life. This is why it is recommended to buy health insurance policy when young.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Policy Term:</strong> Most health insurance plans come for a period of 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years. Greater the policy term you choose, the greater will be your coverage, and hence higher will be your health insurance premium, and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Lifestyle Habits:</strong> If you drink alcohol or smoke regularly, then you may be denied health insurance completely. However, there are some insurance companies that cover you for the same, for which they charge high premiums. This is because, with these lifestyle habits, you are more prone to health issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. Family Medical History:</strong> Before deciding your health insurance premium, the insurance company will ask about your family medical history. This is because if someone in your family has a certain disease that you are also vulnerable to, then the insurance company will charge you a higher premium due to increased risk. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6. Sum Insured:</strong> Health insurance plans come with different sum insured options that you can choose from as per your budget and requirement. The higher the sum insured, the higher the medical coverage and hence higher the health insurance premium. But it is not recommended to compromise on the sum insured to save on premiums. This is because it will not cover you adequately in the time of need. &nbsp;</p>" }, { "title": "Can I cancel my health insurance policy? If yes, will I get a refund for the same?", "defaultOpen": "off", "description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes. You can cancel your health insurance policy. Every health insurance company provides you a free look period to understand the policy terms and conditions. During this period, if you find any objectionable clause in your health insurance policy, then you can cancel the policy and ask for a refund. Note that you will receive the refund only if no claim has been made during the policy term. The amount of refund will be calculated after taking into consideration the expenses incurred on medical check-ups, stamp duty, and proportionate risk premium, i.e. the number of days you have been covered for risks under the policy.

The insurance companies determine premiums after considering various factors that are explained below:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Type of Insurance Plan:</strong> Your health insurance premium is based on the type of plan you choose. If you choose a critical illness insurance plan, then the premium will be high. If you choose an individual health insurance policy, then the premium will be different from that of a family floater plan. To know the difference in health insurance premiums, you can use InsuranceDekho&rsquo;s health insurance premium calculator. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Age of the Insured:</strong> With age, you become more prone to health issues and are more likely to make health insurance claims. Therefore, you are required to pay higher premiums if you buy health insurance plans in later stages of life. This is why it is recommended to buy health insurance policy when young.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Policy Term:</strong> Most health insurance plans come for a period of 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years. Greater the policy term you choose, the greater will be your coverage, and hence higher will be your health insurance premium, and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Lifestyle Habits:</strong> If you drink alcohol or smoke regularly, then you may be denied health insurance completely. However, there are some insurance companies that cover you for the same, for which they charge high premiums. This is because, with these lifestyle habits, you are more prone to health issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. Family Medical History:</strong> Before deciding your health insurance premium, the insurance company will ask about your family medical history. This is because if someone in your family has a certain disease that you are also vulnerable to, then the insurance company will charge you a higher premium due to increased risk. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6. Sum Insured:</strong> Health insurance plans come with different sum insured options that you can choose from as per your budget and requirement. The higher the sum insured, the higher the medical coverage and hence higher the health insurance premium. But it is not recommended to compromise on the sum insured to save on premiums. This is because it will not cover you adequately in the time of need. &nbsp;</p>" } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "Can I cancel my health insurance policy? If yes, will I get a refund for the same?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes. You can cancel your health insurance policy. Every health insurance company provides you a free look period to understand the policy terms and conditions. During this period, if you find any objectionable clause in your health insurance policy, then you can cancel the policy and ask for a refund. Note that you will receive the refund only if no claim has been made during the policy term. The amount of refund will be calculated after taking into consideration the expenses incurred on medical check-ups, stamp duty, and proportionate risk premium, i.e. the number of days you have been covered for risks under the policy. To know more about a premium refunds, it is recommended to go through the policy document. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>" } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "How can I renew my health insurance policy?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "<p>It is imperative to renew your health insurance policy to avail continued coverage, and save on accumulated benefits such as waiting period benefits and No Claim Bonus (NCB).

Following are some of the key benefits of a health insurance plan -", "description": "<ul><li><h3>Comprehensive Coverage</h3>A health insurance policy keeps you covered for major healthcare expenses incurred in case of medical emergency. Usually, health insurance plans keep you protected for in-patient hospitalisation expenses pre-hospitalisation and post-hospitalisation expenses, ambulance expenses, domiciliary hospitalisation expenses, daycare procedures, organ donor expenses, treatments taken under AYUSH systems of medicines, etc.</li>\r\n\t<li><h3>Lifetime Renewability</h3>As per the guidelines issued by Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA), the insurance companies offering health insurance plans are supposed to offer lifetime renewability benefits to the policyholders. It allows you to renew your health insurance policy without any upper restriction on the maximum age limit. The feature is most beneficial for parents and senior citizens as they can renew their insurance plans without any pressure of looking for new health insurance plans in old age. <i>\r\n\t<li><h3>Cashless Treatment</h3>Insurance companies have tie-ups with certain hospitals,  known as network hospitals, where the insured can avail cashless treatment. If you avail treatment at these hospitals, the insurance company will directly settle the bills at the hospital, and you will not be required to pay anything for the treatment availed, except for non-medical expenses incurred.</li>\r\n\t<li><h3>Portability</h3>Health insurance portability allows the policyholders to switch from their existing health insurance company to another, in case they are not satisfied with their existing health insurance plan, or find a more suitable plan. Portability feature saves the policyholders from being taken for granted and offers them flexibility to switch in case of dissatisfaction. </li>\r\n\t<li><span></span><h3>Tax Benefits Under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961</h3> The government of India promotes health insurance by offering tax exemptions of up to Rs. 1.5 Lakh on the premium paid for health insurance plans, under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961. An individual can also claim a deduction of up to Rs. 25,000 for insurance cover for self, spouse, and dependent children. You can also avail a tax deduction of up to Rs. 25,000/Rs. 50,000 for health insurance plans purchased for parents aged 60 years/ more than 60 years.</li>\r\n</ul>" }, "policies": { "heading": "Top Health Insurance Companies in India 2021", "description": "Here is a list of the best health insurance companies compiled on the basis of Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR) registered by them for the financial year 2019-2020.", "btnText": "View All", "btnTitle": "View All", "table": { "heading": ["Health Insurance Company", "Health Claim Settlement Ratio FY20"], "content": [[{ "text": "IFFCO Tokio General Insurance" }, { "text": "96.33%" }], [{ "text": "Care Health Insurance " }, { "text": "95.47%" }], [{ "text": "Magma HDI Health Insurance" }, { "text": "95.17%" }], [{ "text": "The Oriental Insurance Company" }, { "text": "93.96%" }], [{ "text": "New India General Insurance" }, { "text": "92.68%" }], [{ "text": "Bajaj Allianz General Insurance" }, { "text": "92.24%" }], [{ "text": "Max Bupa Health Insurance" }, { "text": "89.46%" }], [{ "text": "Navi General Insurance" }, { "text": "86.98%" }], [{ "text": "HDFC ERGO General Insurance" }, { "text": "86.52%" }], [{ "text": "Manipal Cigna Health Insurance" }, { "text": "85.72%" }], [{ "text": "Edelweiss General Insurance" }, { "text": "85.57%" }], [{ "text": "National Insurance Company" }, { "text": "83.78%" }], [{ "text": "Future Generali General Insurance" }, { "text": "82.96%" }], [{ "text": "Royal Sundaram General Insurance" }, { "text": "81.50%" }], [{ "text": "Liberty General Insurance" }, { "text": "81.03%" }], [{ "text": "ICICI Lombard General Insurance" }, { "text": "78.67%" }], [{ "text": "Star Health Insurance" }, { "text": "78.62%" }], [{ "text": "United India Insurance Company" }, { "text": "78.03%" }], [{ "text": "Reliance General Insurance" }, { "text": "76.43%" }], [{ "text": "Tata AIG General Insurance" }, { "text": "76.04%" }], [{ "text": "Bharti AXA General Insurance" }, { "text": "76.01%" }], [{ "text": "Kotak Mahindra General Insurance" }, { "text": "75.45%" }], [{ "text": "Acko General Insurance" }, { "text": "74.09%" }], [{ "text": "Aditya Birla Health Insurance" }, { "text": "70.81%" }], [{ "text": "Universal Sompo General Insurance" }, { "text": "70.75%" }], [{ "text": "SBI General Insurance" }, { "text": "66.08%" }], [{ "text": "Go Digit General Insurance" }, { "text": "63.56%" }], [{ "text": "Cholamandalam MS General Insurance" }, { "text": "56.25%" }]] } }, "coronaInfo": { "title": "Coronavirus Health Insurance", "subTitle": "", "description": "<p>Standard health insurance plans provide coverage for the treatment of coronavirus (COVID-19).

Type of Insurance Plan:</strong> Your health insurance premium is based on the type of plan you choose. If you choose a critical illness insurance plan, then the premium will be high.

Greater the policy term you choose, the greater will be your coverage, and hence higher will be your health insurance premium, and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Lifestyle Habits:</strong> If you drink alcohol or smoke regularly, then you may be denied health insurance completely. However, there are some insurance companies that cover you for the same, for which they charge high premiums. This is because, with these lifestyle habits, you are more prone to health issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. Family Medical History:</strong> Before deciding your health insurance premium, the insurance company will ask about your family medical history. This is because if someone in your family has a certain disease that you are also vulnerable to, then the insurance company will charge you a higher premium due to increased risk. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6. Sum Insured:</strong> Health insurance plans come with different sum insured options that you can choose from as per your budget and requirement. The higher the sum insured, the higher the medical coverage and hence higher the health insurance premium. But it is not recommended to compromise on the sum insured to save on premiums. This is because it will not cover you adequately in the time of need. &nbsp;</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I cancel my health insurance policy?
