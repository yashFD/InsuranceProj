															holding a long-term third party plan. Now, they can now have
															a long-term third-party insurance plan of 5 years and a
															standalone own damage plan of 1 year, which they can renew
															every year.
														</p>
														<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span></span>3. Economical</h3>
														<p style="text-align: justify;" rel="text-align: justify;">With
															the breakup of long-term comprehensive insurance plan into
															long-term third-party insurance and short-term own damage
															plan, the insurance plans have now become economical for the
															policyholders. Also, the policyholders can buy their own
															damage policy from the insurers providing the most
															affordable insurance offers that can enhance their financial
															benefits.
														</p>
														<h2>Who Should Buy a Standalone Own Damage Two Wheeler
															Insurance?</h2>
														<p>A standalone own-damage cover will compensate the
															policyholder for losses including accidental damages,
															damages due to transit, theft or vandalism, natural
															calamities and man-made disasters. However, the limit to the
															compensation you can receive depends on the <a
																href="idv.html">insured declared value of two
																wheeler</a>. The IDV, in turn, is heavily determined by
															the depreciation rate which gets higher with the bike’s age.
															The following table explains how the depreciation rate
															works:
														</p>
														<table>
															<tbody>
																<tr>
																	<td>
																		<p> <strong>Vehicle Age</strong>
																		</p>
																	</td>
																	<td>
																		<p><strong>Depreciation Rate</strong>
																		</p>
																	</td>
																</tr>
																<tr>
																	<td>
																		<p>0-6 months
																		</p>
																	</td>
																	<td>
																		<p>5%
																		</p>
																	</td>
																</tr>
																<tr>
																	<td>
																		<p>6 months - 1 year
																		</p>
																	</td>
																	<td>
																		<p>15%
																		</p>
																	</td>
																</tr>
																<tr>
																	<td>
																		<p>1 - 2 years
																		</p>
																	</td>
																	<td>
																		<p>20%
																		</p>
																	</td>
																</tr>
																<tr>
																	<td>
																		<p>2-3 years
																		</p>
																	</td>
																	<td>
																		<p>30%
																		</p>
																	</td>
																</tr>
																<tr>
																	<td>
																		<p>3-4 years
																		</p>
																	</td>
																	<td>
																		<p>40%
																		</p>
																	</td>
																</tr>
																<tr>
																	<td>
																		<p>4-5 years
																		</p>
																	</td>
																	<td>
																		<p>50%
																		</p>
																	</td>
																</tr>
															</tbody>
														</table>
														<p>Thus with the depreciation rate affecting your compensation
															value, there are points when after the 5-year mark it may
															make more financial sense to simply set aside some money for
															your possible mishap and keep only your third-party
															insurance updated. However, keep in mind, if your bike is
															new, or an expensive bike it makes sense to keep the
															own-damage cover since the compensation even with high
															depreciation rates still offers quite a bit of money.
															Lastly, you can also purchase a zero depreciation cover as
															an add-on to the existing own-damage plan.
														</p>
														<h2>How Much Protection Needs to be Availed for Standalone Own
															Damage Insurance?</h2>
														<p>In the case of your own damage insurance plan, the amount of
															protection that needs to be availed is dependent upon the
															IDV of the bike. Generally, a bike insurance coverage is
															dependent upon the Insured Declared Value of the
															two-wheeler, wherein the <a href="companies.html">bike
																insurance provider</a> makes payment only up to the IDV
															if any eventuality happens. Therefore, it would be right to
															assume that the amount that will be received by you will be
															dependent upon the existing market value of your bike.
														</p>
														<h2></h2>
														<h2>How is the Own-Damage Cover Premium Calculated?</h2>
														<p>There are three main factors that are accounted for when
															calculating the <a href="premium-calculator.html">bike
																insurance premium</a> of a standalone own-damage bike
															insurance policy. The bike’s IDV, it’s cubic capacity and
															the age of the vehicle. However, doing this manually can be
															a tricky business. Hence, we have a premium calculator that
															will do all the work for you.</p>

														<h2>How to File for Standalone Own Damage Two Wheeler Insurance?
														</h2>
														<p>The following are the documents required to file for the <a
																href="claim-settlement.html">bike insurance claim</a>:
														</p>
														<ul>
															<li>Copy of policy document</li>
															<li>Copy of FIR</li>
															<li>Copy of registration certificate</li>
															<li>Original bills of the bike’s repair</li>
															<li>Evidence of the mishap</li>
														</ul>
														<p>The following are the steps required to file for the bike
															insurance claim:
														</p>
														<p><strong>1. Inform the Insurance Provider:</strong> In case of
															a mishap make sure to take all the safety measures and then
															call the insurance provider of your bike as soon as
															possible.
														</p>
														<p><strong>2. Lodge an FIR:</strong> In case your bike is stolen
															or there is any sort of accident involving others it is
															crucial to file an FIR at the nearest police station. You
															will require a copy of the same when filing for an insurance
															claim.
														</p>
														<p><strong>3. Collect Proof:</strong> When you make a claim you
															need to provide proof of the incident being a genuine
															mishap. Hence collect as much evidence as you can, take
															pictures or videos and note down the contact of any
															bystander who saw the incident as well.
														</p>
														<p><strong>4. Submit Documents:</strong> The documents required
															for the claim process may vary slightly according to your
															situation and/or insurance provider. The most common
															documents required are listed above and need to be submitted
															to the insurance provider to process the claim settlement.
														</p>
														<p><strong>5. Surveyor:</strong> After the documents are
															submitted, the insurance company will schedule a visit with
															the surveyor. He/She will check the damages to the bike to
															ensure the damage. The surveyor may ask you questions to
															make sure to answer them honestly, any discrepancies can
															lead to your claim request being cancelled.
														</p>
														<p><strong>6. Repairs:</strong> After the surveyor approves the
															claim you can send your bike for repairs. It is best to do
															this in one of the insurance provider’s network garages.
															This way the cost of the repair will be compensated directly
															with the garage with no out-of-pocket costs for you.

													​Which Add-ons Available With Own Damage Bike Insurance Cover?</h2>
												<div>
													<div>
														<p>Below are the add-ons that can be opted with standalone own
															damage bike insurance cover:</p>
														<h3>1. <a
																href="add-on-covers/return-to-invoiceea48.html?_preview=true">Return
																to Invoice Cover</a></h3>

															case policyholders’ insured bike gets stolen or damaged
															beyond repair, then return to invoice cover let’s the
															policyholder to get full invoice price for their insured
															bike.</p>
														<h3>2. <a href="zero-depreciation.html">Zero Depreciation
																Cover</a></h3>
														<p style="text-align: justify;">A nil depreciation cover assists
															the policyholder in mitigating the burden of bearing the
															depreciation cost which is incurred by the bike in order to
															help them in claiming a bigger amount. Almost all insurance
															companies allow you to make two zero depreciation claims at
															maximum. However, there are a few insurance companies that
															allow the policyholder to make unlimited nil depreciation
															claims like IFFCO Tokio General Insurance Company, New India
															Assurance Company, and Royal Sundaram General Insurance
															Company.</p>
														<h3>3. <a href="add-on-covers/consumables.html">Consumables
																Cover</a></h3>
														<p style="text-align: justify;">Bike insurance consumable add on
															cover offers coverage for the entire consumable items in a
															two wheeler like grease, oil filter, screw, bolt, etc.</p>
														<h3>4. <a href="add-on-covers/roadside-assistance.html">Roadside

															event of loss of keys etc.</p>
														<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors That Affect Standalone
															Own Damage Bike Insurance Premium</h2>
														<p style="text-align: justify;">The following factors affect the
															own damage bike insurance premium:</p>
														<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Insured Declared
																Value - </strong>One of the primary factors affecting
															the Own Damage premium for a policyholder's two-wheeler is
															Insured Declared Value, which is the correct market value of
															the insured vehicle.</p>
														<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span></span>2. Bike’s
																Engine Capacity - </strong>The speed of the two-wheeler
															is determined by the bike’s CC, therefore, the risk
															associated with the policyholder's bike. Hence, the bike’s
															cc is an important factor in determining the Own damage
															premium. Moreover, the higher is the bike cc, the higher
															would be the own damage premium and vice versa.</p>
														<p style="text-align: justify;" rel="text-align: justify;">
															<strong><span></span>3. Bike’s Age - </strong>The newer the
															bike is, the higher would be its own damage premium and vice
															versa.</p>
														<p style="text-align: justify;" rel="text-align: justify;">
															<strong><span></span>4. No Claim Bonus - </strong>The
															policyholder who priorly had an own damage comprehensive
															bike insurance cover and did not make any claims can
															transfer their accumulated <a
																href="add-on-covers/protection-of-ncb.html">NCB</a> for
															a discount on present own damage premium.</p>
														<p style="text-align: justify;" rel="text-align: justify;">
															<strong><span></span>5. Add-Ons Opted - </strong>Depending
															upon the type and number of add on covers chosen, the
															policyholders' current own damage premium will be affected
															accordingly.</p>

													<p>Every insurance policy has an expiry date. Most policies are
														valid for a year, hence need to be renewed annually. If you
														forget to renew your two-wheeler insurance on time the policy
														expires and any NCB that you had accumulated is also lost. Since
														it is common for policyholders to forget about the renewal due
														to their busy and hectic lives insurance providers offer a grace
														period. Insurance holders have a chance to renew their
														two-wheeler insurance within 90 days after the expiry date
														without any losses. However, any delays that occur after this
														period cannot be helped. The policy will lapse/ expire and can
														no longer be renewed. In such cases, the customer will be
														required to purchase a fresh insurance policy and go through
														inspection formalities once again.</p>

													<p>Third party insurance is a compulsory cover for two-wheelers in
														India. If caught without it you can be fined Rs 2000 and/or be

														care of third party liabilities that include bodily injury,
														death and property damage. On the other hand, own-damage covers
														are not obligatory for two-wheelers. Moreover, the coverage they
														provide is different from third party insurance. It takes care
														of own-damage costs rather than third party liabilities. Hence,

											<div data-gsp-accordion-content="" class="content  " data-default="off">
												<div>
													<p>To file a claim for your two-wheeler own-damage cover insurance
														follow these steps:</p>
													<ul>
														<p>Step 1: In case of an accident, theft or vandalism file an
															FIR at the nearest police station as soon as possible. A
															copy of the FIR will be required for the claim process. If
															there is a natural or manmade calamity that damages your
															two-wheeler an FIR is not required however try and take
															images or videos clearly showing the damage if you can.</p>
													</ul>
													<ul>
														<p>Step 2: Contact your insurance provider and let them know
															about the situation. The documents you will be required to
															submit will differ according to the situation. Remember to
															clarify which ones you will need.</p>
													</ul>
													<ul>
														<p>Step 3: Fill up the claim form and submit it along with the
															documents required by your insurance provider.</p>
													</ul>
													<ul>
														<p>Step 4: If the two-wheeler is damaged and needs to be
															repaired the insurance provider will first send a surveyor
															to assess it. Once they file a report the insurance claim
															will then go through a verification process before it can be
															approved.</p>
													</ul>
													<ul>
														<p>Step 5: Once approved you can take your two-wheeler to the
															nearest garage and get it repaired and the cost will be
															compensated. If you go to a network garage the cost will be
															settled in a cashless manner making it hassle-free for you.
															If the two-wheeler was stolen however or damaged beyond
															repair the insurance provider will compensate the IDV of the
															two-wheeler after you hand over any documents or items
															related to it such as the keys.</p>

											<div data-gsp-accordion-content="" class="content  " data-default="off">

													<p>The premium amount of your own-damage two-wheeler insurance is
														determined mainly by the Insured Declared Value. The IDV of the
														two-wheeler is the maximum compensation the insurance provider
														will give the policyholder in case of a mishap. The IDV takes
														into account the depreciation rate of the two-wheeler. Hence,
														the older the two-wheeler the lower the IDV, this affects both
														the claim amount and the insurance premium. Thus, as your
														two-wheeler gets older with every passing year the depreciation
														rate increases making the IDV, claim amount and premium amount
														lower.</p>

However, it is recommended that every two-wheeler rider also purchase an own-damage cover. This type of insurance offers far wider coverage and will compensate the rider in a time of crisis. It is guaranteed to provide a sense of relief from the uncertainties and risks that are associated with riding a two-wheeler.</p>" }, { "title": "How Can My Own-Damage Two-Wheeler Insurance be Renewed After Expiry?", "defaultOpen": "off", "description": "<p>Every insurance policy has an expiry date. Most policies are valid for a year, hence need to be renewed annually. If you forget to renew your two-wheeler insurance on time the policy expires and any NCB that you had accumulated is also lost. Since it is common for policyholders to forget about the renewal due to their busy and hectic lives insurance providers offer a grace period. Insurance holders have a chance to renew their two-wheeler insurance within 90 days after the expiry date without any losses. However, any delays that occur after this period cannot be helped. The policy will lapse/ expire and can no longer be renewed. In such cases, the customer will be required to purchase a fresh insurance policy and go through inspection formalities once again.</p>" }, { "title": "Is it Better to Purchase an Own-Damage Cover or Third Party Insurance?", "defaultOpen": "off", "description": "<p>Third party insurance is a compulsory cover for two-wheelers in India. If caught without it you can be fined Rs 2000 and/or be imprisoned for up to 3 months. Additionally, the cover takes care of third party liabilities that include bodily injury, death and property damage. On the other hand, own-damage covers are not obligatory for two-wheelers. Moreover, the coverage they provide is different from third party insurance. It takes care of own-damage costs rather than third party liabilities. Hence, the two covers complement each other. It is best to purchase an own-damage cover along with your third party insurance for all-round protection.</p>" }, { "title": "How do I File a Claim for My Own-Damage Two-Wheeler Insurance?", "defaultOpen": "off", "description": "<p>To file a claim for your two-wheeler own-damage cover insurance follow these steps:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<p>Step 1: In case of an accident, theft or vandalism file an FIR at the nearest police station as soon as possible. A copy of the FIR will be required for the claim process. If there is a natural or manmade calamity that damages your two-wheeler an FIR is not required however try and take images or videos clearly showing the damage if you can.</p></ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<p>Step 2: Contact your insurance provider and let them know about the situation. The documents you will be required to submit will differ according to the situation. Remember to clarify which ones you will need.</p></ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<p>Step 3: Fill up the claim form and submit it along with the documents required by your insurance provider.</p></ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<p>Step 4: If the two-wheeler is damaged and needs to be repaired the insurance provider will first send a surveyor to assess it.

The IDV of the two-wheeler is the maximum compensation the insurance provider will give the policyholder in case of a mishap. The IDV takes into account the depreciation rate of the two-wheeler. Hence, the older the two-wheeler the lower the IDV, this affects both the claim amount and the insurance premium. Thus, as your two-wheeler gets older with every passing year the depreciation rate increases making the IDV, claim amount and premium amount lower.</p>" }] }, "topVehicles": { "title": "Bike Insurance

Accidental Damages</strong> - This plan gives coverage for the damages sustained by your bike in an accident or collision.\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2.

Fire </strong>-<strong> </strong>This plan also covers the own damages caused to your bike by fire and explosions.\r\n</p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What Is Not Covered Under OD Bike Insurance?</h2><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The following things are not covered in standalone own damage two-wheeler insurance:\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Third Party Liability - </strong>Only the losses or damages caused to own vehicle is covered under standalone own damage bike insurance. It does not offer coverage for third party losses or damages.\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Consequential Damages - </strong>Damages that have been caused to the bike consequently and not during an accident are not covered under standalone own damage.\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Contributory Negligence -</strong> In case the policyholder does something on purpose that they were not supposed to do, then in that case their two-wheeler would not get covered. For instance, it is raining heavily and the whole city is flooded and if the policyholder still went out on their two-wheeler for a ride which consequently leads to the damages.\r\n</p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Benefits of Two-Wheeler Own Damage Insurance</h2><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A standalone own damage two-wheeler insurance plan offers the following benefits to policyholders:\r\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Option of Different insurers</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the introduction of standalone own damage bike insurance plans, the bike insurance policyholders can now opt for a third party insurance cover and an own damage insurance cover from different insurance providers of their choice.\r\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span></span>2. Flexibility in Tenure of Own Damage Plan</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\" rel=\"text-align: justify;\">The new bike owners are no more bound to purchase a long-term comprehensive insurance policy due to the compulsion of holding a long-term third party plan. Now, they can now have a long-term third-party insurance plan of 5 years and a standalone own damage plan of 1 year, which they can renew every year.\r\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span></span>3. Economical</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\" rel=\"text-align: justify;\">With the breakup of long-term comprehensive insurance plan into long-term third-party insurance and short-term own damage plan, the insurance plans have now become economical for the policyholders. Also, the policyholders can buy their own damage policy from the insurers providing the most affordable insurance offers that can enhance their financial benefits.\r\n</p><h2>Who Should Buy a Standalone Own Damage Two Wheeler Insurance?</h2><p>A standalone own-damage cover will compensate the policyholder for losses including accidental damages, damages due to transit, theft or vandalism, natural calamities and man-made disasters. However, the limit to the compensation you can receive depends on the <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/idv\">insured declared value of two wheeler</a>. The IDV, in turn, is heavily determined by the depreciation rate which gets higher with the bike’s age. The following table explains how the depreciation rate works:\r\n</p><table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p> <strong>Vehicle Age</strong>\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Depreciation Rate</strong>\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>0-6 months\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>5%\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>6 months - 1 year\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>15%\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>1  - 2 years\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>20%\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>2-3 years\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>30%\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>3-4 years\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>40%\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>4-5 years\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>50%\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table><p>Thus with the depreciation rate affecting your compensation value, there are points when after the 5-year mark it may make more financial sense to simply set aside some money for your possible mishap and keep only your third-party insurance updated. However, keep in mind, if your bike is new, or an expensive bike it makes sense to keep the own-damage cover since the compensation even with high depreciation rates still offers quite a bit of money. Lastly, you can also purchase a zero depreciation cover as an add-on to the existing own-damage plan.\r\n</p><h2>How Much Protection Needs to be Availed for Standalone Own Damage Insurance?</h2><p>In the case of your own damage insurance plan, the amount of protection that needs to be availed is dependent upon the IDV of the bike. Generally, a bike insurance coverage is dependent upon the Insured Declared Value of the two-wheeler, wherein the <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/companies\">bike insurance provider</a> makes payment only up to the IDV if any eventuality happens. Therefore, it would be right to assume that the amount that will be received by you will be dependent upon the existing market value of your bike.\r\n</p><h2></h2><h2>How is the Own-Damage Cover Premium Calculated?</h2><p>There are three main factors that are accounted for when calculating the <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/premium-calculator\">bike insurance premium</a> of a standalone own-damage bike insurance policy. The bike’s IDV, it’s cubic capacity and the age of the vehicle. However, doing this manually can be a tricky business. Hence, we have a premium calculator that will do all the work for you.</p><h2>Own Damage Bike Insurance - Renew Policy with InsuranceDekho</h2><p>The following steps will help you renew your bike insurance policy online:\r\n</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit our website <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/\">InsuranceDekho</a>\r\n</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Provide your bike’s registration number, fuel type and variant to proceed.

Almost all insurance companies allow you to make two zero depreciation claims at maximum. However, there are a few insurance companies that allow the policyholder to make unlimited nil depreciation claims like IFFCO Tokio General Insurance Company, New India Assurance Company, and Royal Sundaram General Insurance Company.</p><h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/add-on-covers/consumables\">Consumables Cover</a></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bike insurance consumable add on cover offers coverage for the entire consumable items in a two wheeler like grease, oil filter, screw, bolt, etc.</p><h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/add-on-covers/roadside-assistance\">Roadside Assistance</a></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Roadside Assistance add on cover in two wheeler insurance offers assistance services to the policyholder during the incidence of a vehicle breakdown.

Bike’s Engine Capacity - </strong>The speed of the two-wheeler is determined by the bike’s CC, therefore, the risk associated with the policyholder's bike. Hence, the bike’s cc is an important factor in determining the Own damage premium. Moreover, the higher is the bike cc, the higher would be the own damage premium and vice versa.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\" rel=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span></span>3.
