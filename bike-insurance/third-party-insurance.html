														<h2>Advantages of A Third Party Bike Insurance</h2>
														<p>Here are some advantages of owning a third party bike
															insurance plan:
														</p>
														<p><strong>Easy Documentation</strong>: This plan involves an
															easy documentation process that can be completed with just a
															few formalities. Fewer inspections and checks are required
															as the motorbike is not insured under this plan. Also, you
															can purchase this plan according to your convenience and
															time.
														</p>
														<p><strong>Simple Online Procedure</strong>: Almost <a
																href="../companies.html">all insurance companies</a>
															nowadays offer their services online, wherein you can also
															purchase the insurance plan online with just a few clicks.
															With an online purchase process, it becomes much more
															simpler and convenient to purchase an insurance plan.
														</p>
														<p><strong>No Financial Obligation</strong>: Under a third party
															liability insurance plan for a two-wheeler, the financial
															liabilities of the insured against any loss or damage caused
															to any third party property or person is covered
														</p>
														<p><strong>Mandated by Law</strong>: Since it is mandatory to
															get your bike insured at least with a third party liability
															plan as per Indian Motor Tariff Act, it will ensure that you
															are obeying legal obligations.
														</p>
														<p><strong>No Stress</strong>: Accidents can happen anytime and
															leave you traumatized, especially if any third party
															undergoes any loss and you are required to bear the cost for
															the same. Therefore, with a third-party insurance plan you
															are relieved from mental stress as all the financial
															obligations against the third party are handled by the
															insurance company in place of you.

														<h2>Long Term Third Party Cover for Five Years for New Bike
															Owners</h2>
														<p>As per the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of
															India (IRDAI), the owners of new two-wheeler vehicles are
															required to hold a third-party liability policy of five
															years for which they should pay upfront. To acquire such a
															multi-year or long-term insurance plan is compulsory while
															buying a bike or scooter.
														</p>
														<p>The long-term third party two-wheeler insurance will offer
															coverage for damages incurred by the third party through
															bodily injuries, death and property damage due to the
															insured vehicle. But, it will not compensate for any sort of
															damages which are sustained by the two-wheeler of the
															insured person. This insurance policy is economical in
															comparison to a comprehensive bike insurance policy due to
															its limited coverage. However, there are various benefits
															that policyholders can avail themselves with this long-term
															third party cover. Some of which are as follow:
															<strong></strong>
														</p>
														<ol>
															<li><strong>Completes Legal Compulsion</strong> - To hold a
																two-wheeler third party insurance is mandatory in India.
																Also, for new two-wheeler buyers, it is also a
																compulsion to own long-term third party insurance which
																is of 5 years. Hence, the purchase of a long term third
																party policy will complete your legal compulsion.</li>
															<li><strong>Provides Financial Assistance</strong> - A
																third-party two-wheeler insurance plan gives you a
																financial cushion against the liabilities which may
																arise due to an accident or death. With this insurance
																cover, the third party person will get immediate benefit
																from the insurance company.</li>
															<li><strong>No Hassle of Every Year Renewal</strong> - The
																long term third party insurance cover for two-wheelers
																is the most suitable option for people who want to pay
																the amount of premium in one go. However, with this
																insurance plan, it will not be possible for
																policyholders to port to another insurance provider next
																year.</li>
														</ol>
														<h2>What All Is Covered Under A Third Party Two-Wheeler Cover?
														</h2>
														<ul>
															<li><strong>Third Party Property Damage</strong>: Any third
																party property damage caused by the insured’s
																two-wheeler is covered under the third party/liability
																only insurance policy up to Rs.1 lakh. </li>
														</ul>
														<ul>
															<li><strong>Third-Party Death/Bodily Injury</strong>: The
																compensation amount in case of third party bodily
																injuries/death is decided by a court of law. In case of
																loss of both the limbs or both eye sights/ permanent
																disability or death of a third party, the insurer
																provides 100% compensation. Whereas, in case of partial
																disabilities like bodily injuries or loss of one limb or
																loss of one eyesight, the insurer provides 50%
																compensation.</li>
														</ul>
														<h2>What Is Not Covered Under 3rd Party Two-Wheeler Insurance?
														</h2>
														<p>A 3rd party two-wheeler insurance does not cover any damage
															incurred by the insured’s two-wheeler or its owner or
															driver. You can opt for comprehensive two-wheeler insurance
															or <a href="standalone-own-damage-cover.html">standalone
																own-damage two-wheeler insurance</a> to get your
															two-wheeler insured for own-damages. For insuring yourself
															or the driver of your two-wheeler, you can purchase a
															personal accident cover or paid driver cover as per the
															requirement.<br>

															<li>The insurance company analyses the claim report sent by
																the surveyor as well as documents submitted by the
																policyholder. If everything is fine, then the insurance
																company approves the claim and settles it.</li>

																			<p>The best insurance company changes from

																				plan, add-on covers, customer support
																				service, etc. However, a reliable
																				parameter to compare different insurance
																				companies for bike insurance plans is
																				the Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR)
																				registered by them.<br /></p>
																			<p>Claim Settlement Ratio is the percentage
																				of claims settled by a car insurance
																				company out of the total number of
																				claims received by it during a financial
																				year. The higher the claim settlement
																				ratio, the better it is. In the
																				financial year 2018-19, IFFCO Tokio

																				Sundaram General Insurance (94.07%) and
																				The Oriental Insurance (93.16%)
																				registered the highest Claim Settlement
																				Ratio for motor claims as per IBAI’s

To acquire such a multi-year or long-term insurance plan is compulsory while buying a bike or scooter.\r\n</p><p>The long-term third party two-wheeler insurance will offer coverage for damages incurred by the third party through bodily injuries, death and property damage due to the insured vehicle. But, it will not compensate for any sort of damages which are sustained by the two-wheeler of the insured person. This insurance policy is economical in comparison to a comprehensive bike insurance policy due to its limited coverage. However, there are various benefits that policyholders can avail themselves with this long-term third party cover. Some of which are as follow:\r\n\t<strong></strong>\r\n</p><ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Completes Legal Compulsion</strong> - To hold a two-wheeler third party insurance is mandatory in India. Also, for new two-wheeler buyers, it is also a compulsion to own long-term third party insurance which is of 5 years. Hence, the purchase of a long term third party policy will complete your legal compulsion.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Provides Financial Assistance</strong> - A third-party two-wheeler insurance plan gives you a financial cushion against the liabilities which may arise due to an accident or death. With this insurance cover, the third party person will get immediate benefit from the insurance company.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>No Hassle of Every Year Renewal</strong> - The long term third party insurance cover for two-wheelers is the most suitable option for people who want to pay the amount of premium in one go. However, with this insurance plan, it will not be possible for policyholders to port to another insurance provider next year.</li>\r\n</ol><h2>What All Is Covered Under A Third Party Two-Wheeler Cover?\r\n</h2><ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Third Party Property Damage</strong>: Any third party property damage caused by the insured’s two-wheeler is covered under the third party/liability only insurance policy up to Rs.1 lakh. </li>\r\n</ul><ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Third-Party Death/Bodily Injury</strong>: The compensation amount in case of third party bodily injuries/death is decided by a court of law. In case of loss of both the limbs or both eye sights/ permanent disability or death of a third party, the insurer provides 100% compensation. Whereas, in case of partial disabilities like bodily injuries or loss of one limb or loss of one eyesight, the insurer provides 50% compensation.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>What Is Not Covered Under 3rd Party Two-Wheeler Insurance?</h2><p>A 3rd party two-wheeler insurance does not cover any damage incurred by the insured’s two-wheeler or its owner or driver. You can opt for comprehensive two-wheeler insurance or <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/standalone-own-damage-cover\">standalone own-damage two-wheeler insurance</a> to get your two-wheeler insured for own-damages.
