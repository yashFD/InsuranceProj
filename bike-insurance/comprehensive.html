												<h2 content="Benefits of Comprehensive Bike Insurance Plans">Benefits of
													Comprehensive Bike Insurance Plans</h2>
												<div>
													<div>
														<p>With a comprehensive bike insurance plan, you can become
															tension-free from the protection of your bike, the safety of
															the bike rider alongside liability arising towards the
															damage/loss of the third party person or property. Through a
															comprehensive bike insurance plan, a policyholder can enjoy
															the benefits of both a third-party insurance plan as well as
															a <a href="standalone-own-damage-cover.html">standalone own
																damage insurance</a> plan.
														</p>
														<p>Highlighted below are some of the benefits of purchasing a
															comprehensive bike insurance policy in India:<br>
														</p>
														<ul>
															<li>
																<h3>Offers Coverage For Third Party Liability</h3>
															</li>
														</ul>
														<p>A comprehensive insurance policy covers the legal liability
															towards a third party property or person caused due to an
															accident or mishap. The coverage includes damage or loss to
															the property, damage of two-wheeler parts, and bodily
															injuries or demise of a third party caused due to a
															collision with the insured bike at the time of an accident
															or mishap.
														</p>
														<ul>
															<li>
																<h3>Safeguards Your Own Bike</h3>
															</li>
														</ul>
														<p>A comprehensive bike insurance plan offers coverage to your
															two-wheeler against any accident or mishap. Also, it
															protects your bike against the damages or losses caused by
															other natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, tsunami,
															thunderstorms, etc., and manmade activities like theft,
															burglary, riots and so on. In case of complete loss or the
															damage/loss to your bike is beyond repair then in such
															scenarios, the policyholder can claim for the IDV of the
															bike.
														</p>
														<ul>
															<li>
																<h3>Personal Accident Cover</h3>
															</li>
														</ul>
														<p>The comprehensive bike insurance plans are available with a
															<a href="add-on-covers/medical-cover.html">personal accident
																cover</a> of up to Rs. 15 lakh with which policyholders
															become insured against injuries that may result in total or
															partial permanent or temporary disability or even death. It
															comes as a huge benefit as it gives coverage for bodily
															injuries suffered by the policyholder in a mishap that could
															indulge a huge expense to be incurred in the treatment.
														</p>
														<ul>
															<li>
																<h3>Pillion Rider Cover</h3>
															</li>
														</ul>
														<p>The Pillion Rider Cover is an add-on cover which can be
															included in a comprehensive insurance plan to get the safety
															cover for other riders. The cover is designed to pay out the
															expenses of medical assistance provided to the passenger on
															the bike after an accident. The coverage under this cover
															will be offered for partial or permanent disability or death
															of the pillion rider.
														</p>
														<ul>
															<li>
																<h3>Add-on Covers</h3>
															</li>
														</ul>
														<p>The comprehensive bike insurance plan opens the option to
															include add-on covers in the policy. By paying a little
															extra premium along with the regular amount of premium, you
															can avail of different add-on covers which comprise zero
															depreciation cover, roadside assistance cover, no claim
															bonus protection, return to invoice, etc. These add-on
															covers support you during the <a
																href="claim-settlement.html">claim settlement</a> after
															an accident or unfortunate event.
														</p>
														<h2>Significance Of IDV While Selecting The Bike Insurance
															Policy</h2>
														<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="idv.html">IDV</a>
															stands for Insured Declared Value. It is the maximum amount
															that your insurance company would be providing you, in case
															your two-wheeler gets stolen or gets completely damaged.
															Premiums are an important aspect to be considered while
															choosing a bike insurance policy but do not forget to check
															the Insured declared value of your bike prior to buying an
															insurance policy. Also, it is highly recommended to select a
															higher IDV as at the time of complete loss of your
															two-wheeler, a high IDV would mean a higher reimbursement
															amount.
														</p>
														<h2>What Add-ons Can You Buy with Comprehensive Bike Insurance?
														</h2>
														<p>The add-ons covers are designed to enhance the coverage of an
															insurance policy. They offer flexibility to insurance plans
															by allowing its policyholders to select and pick a cover to
															boost coverage and different aspects of a plan based on
															their suitability. Below given are some of the add-on covers
															which can be included in a comprehensive bike insurance
															cover:
														</p>
														<ul>
															<li>Passenger Cover</li>
															<li>Consumables Cover</li>
															<li>Engine Protector Cover</li>
															<li>Return to Invoice Cover</li>
															<li>Zero Depreciation Cover</li>
															<li>Roadside Assistance Cover</li>
															<li>No Claim Bonus Protect Cover </li>
														</ul>
														<h2>What Is NCB in Comprehensive Bike Insurance?</h2>
														<p>The premium for comprehensive bike insurance plans is higher
															than of third party bike insurance plans as the former
															offers coverage to a third party as well as own-damage
															expenses which contributes to wider coverage, while the
															latter compensates the only third party expenses. Besides,
															the <a href="add-on-covers/protection-of-ncb.html">No Claim
																Bonus</a> or NCB benefit is only offered on the
															own-damage insurance cover within the policy.
														</p>
														<p>The No Claim Bonus is a reward which is provided by the <a
																href="companies.html">bike insurance companies</a> to
															the policyholder for a claim-free year. This benefit is
															cumulative in nature which could go up to 50% with every
															successive claim-free year. Here is the chart that explains
															the calculation of the No Claim Bonus (NCB):

																			<p>A comprehensive bike insurance policy is
																				a complete insurance plan which provides
																				insurance coverage for third party
																				liabilities as well as own-damages
																				incurred by your bike. The third party
																				liabilities include bodily injuries,
																				permanent/temporary disability,
																				partial/total disability and death of
																				third party and property damage of up to
																				Rs. 1 lakh caused by an accident
																				involving the insured’s bike. A
																				comprehensive bike insurance coverage
																				plan provides compensation for
																				own-damages incurred by the insured’s
																				bike in a road accident, natural
																				calamity, fire, explosion, riots
																				strikes, or any other mishap in
																				accordance with the Insured Declared
																				Value (IDV) of the bike. The coverage of
																				a comprehensive bike insurance plan can
																				be further extended with the help of
																				bike insurance add-ons such as zero
																				depreciation cover, road assistance
																				cover, engine protect cover, etc.</p>

																				caused due to an accident caused by the
																				insured’s bike. Whereas a comprehensive

																			<p>No, it is not necessary for either a new

																				per Indian Motor Tariff. Also, a new
																				bike is compulsorily required to have a

																				policy. Riding a bike without a minimum

																			<p>The best insurance company changes from

																				on their requirements such as type of
																				plan, add-on covers, customer support
																				service, etc. However, one reliable
																				parameter to compare different insurance
																				companies for bike insurance plans is
																				the Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR)
																				registered by them.

																				Claim Settlement Ratio is the percentage
																				of claims settled by a car insurance
																				company out of the total number of
																				claims received by it during a financial
																				year. The higher the claim settlement
																				ratio, the better it is. In the
																				financial year 2018-19, IFFCO Tokio
																				General Insurance (96.44%), Royal
																				Sundaram General Insurance (94.07%) and
																				The Oriental Insurance (93.16%)
																				registered the highest Claim Settlement
																				Ratio for motor claims as per IBAI’s
																				General Insurance Claim Insights
																				Handbook For Policyholders.

The third party liabilities include bodily injuries, permanent/temporary disability, partial/total disability and death of third party and property damage of up to Rs. 1 lakh caused by an accident involving the insured’s bike. A comprehensive bike insurance coverage plan provides compensation for own-damages incurred  by the insured’s bike in a road accident, natural calamity, fire, explosion, riots strikes, or any other mishap in accordance with the Insured Declared Value (IDV) of the bike. The coverage of a comprehensive bike insurance plan can be further extended with the help of bike insurance add-ons such as zero depreciation cover, road assistance cover, engine protect cover, etc.</p>" }, { "title": "What is the difference between comprehensive and third party bike insurance?", "defaultOpen": "off", "description": "<p>A third party bike insurance cover is the most basic insurance plan that provides insurance coverage against third party liabilities such as bodily injuries, disability, death and property damage (of up to Rs. 1 lakh) of third party caused due to an accident caused by the insured’s bike. Whereas a comprehensive bike insurance plan is an extensive cover which provides for own-damages incurred by the insured’s bike in addition to the third party liabilities. </p>" }, { "title": "Can I convert 3rd party bike insurance into comprehensive?", "defaultOpen": "off", "description": "<p>No, you cannot convert a third party bike insurance plan into a comprehensive cover. But you can buy a standalone own-damage bike insurance cover, either from the same insurance company or a different insurance company, and get your bike covered against own-damages.</p>" }, { "title": "Which company is better for comprehensive bike insurance renewal?", "defaultOpen": "off", "description": "<p>There are 25 general insurance companies which offer renewal of bike insurance policies. The best insurance company varies from individual to individual depending on factors like availability of online/offline renewal process, ease of renewal, renewal time, etc. You can get your policy renewed in just 2 minutes at InsuranceDekho.</p>" }, { "title": "Is it compulsory to have comprehensive insurance for a new bike?", "defaultOpen": "off", "description": "<p>No, it is not necessary for either a new or an old bike to have a comprehensive bike insurance policy. However, at least a third party bike insurance is a compulsory requirement for all bikes as per Indian Motor Tariff. Also, a new bike is compulsorily required to have a 5-year third party bike insurance policy. Riding a bike without a minimum of a valid third party bike insurance plan is a punishable offence which is punishable with a fine of Rs. 2,000 and/or jail term of up to 3 months.</p>" }, { "title": "What is the difference between a comprehensive bike insurance plan and a zero depreciation bike insurance?", "defaultOpen": "off", "description": "<p>A comprehensive bike insurance is a type of bike insurance plan whereas a zero depreciation cover is a bike insurance add-on. Like any other add-on cover, a zero depreciation cover can be opted with comprehensive bike insurance plans and standalone own-damage bike insurance plans. A zero depreciation cover insures your bike against the depreciation charges incurred by it.</p>" }, { "title": "Which insurance is best for a bike comprehensive or third party bike insurance plan?", "defaultOpen": "off", "description": "<p>The best insurance company changes from policyholder to policyholder depending on their requirements such as type of plan, add-on covers, customer support service, etc. However, one reliable parameter to compare different insurance companies for bike insurance plans is the Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR) registered by them. \r\n\r\nClaim Settlement Ratio is the percentage of claims settled by a car insurance company out of the total number of claims received by it during a financial year. The higher the claim settlement ratio, the better it is. In the financial year 2018-19, IFFCO Tokio General Insurance (96.44%), Royal Sundaram General Insurance (94.07%) and The Oriental Insurance (93.16%) registered the highest Claim Settlement Ratio for motor claims as per IBAI’s General Insurance Claim Insights Handbook For Policyholders.\r\n</p>" }] }, "topVehicles": { "title": "Bike Insurance for Popular Bike Models", "list": [{ "name": "TVS

The coverage includes damage or loss to the property, damage of two-wheeler parts, and bodily injuries or demise of a third party caused due to a collision with the insured bike at the time of an accident or mishap.\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3>Safeguards Your Own Bike</h3></li>\r\n</ul><p>A comprehensive bike insurance plan offers coverage to your two-wheeler against any accident or mishap. Also, it protects your bike against the damages or losses caused by other natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, tsunami, thunderstorms, etc., and manmade activities like theft, burglary, riots and so on. In case of complete loss or the damage/loss to your bike is beyond repair then in such scenarios, the policyholder can claim for the IDV of the bike.\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3>Personal Accident Cover</h3></li>\r\n</ul><p>The comprehensive bike insurance plans are available with a <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/add-on-covers/medical-cover\">personal accident cover</a> of up to Rs. 15 lakh with which policyholders become insured against injuries that may result in total or partial permanent or temporary disability or even death. It comes as a huge benefit as it gives coverage for bodily injuries suffered by the policyholder in a mishap that could indulge a huge expense to be incurred in the treatment.\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3>Pillion Rider Cover</h3></li>\r\n</ul><p>The Pillion Rider Cover is an add-on cover which can be included in a comprehensive insurance plan to get the safety cover for other riders. The cover is designed to pay out the expenses of medical assistance provided to the passenger on the bike after an accident. The coverage under this cover will be offered for partial or permanent disability or death of the pillion rider.\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3>Add-on Covers</h3></li>\r\n</ul><p>The comprehensive bike insurance plan opens the option to include add-on covers in the policy. By paying a little extra premium along with the regular amount of premium, you can avail of different add-on covers which comprise zero depreciation cover, roadside assistance cover, no claim bonus protection, return to invoice, etc. These add-on covers support you during the <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/claim-settlement\">claim settlement</a> after an accident or unfortunate event.\r\n</p><h2>Significance Of IDV While Selecting The Bike Insurance Policy</h2><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/idv\">IDV</a> stands for Insured Declared Value. It is the maximum amount that your insurance company would be providing you, in case your two-wheeler gets stolen or gets completely damaged. Premiums are an important aspect to be considered while choosing a bike insurance policy but do not forget to check the Insured declared value of your bike prior to buying an insurance policy. Also, it is highly recommended to select a higher IDV as at the time of complete loss of your two-wheeler, a high IDV would mean a higher reimbursement amount.\r\n</p><h2>What Add-ons Can You Buy with Comprehensive Bike Insurance?</h2><p>The add-ons covers are designed to enhance the coverage of an insurance policy. They offer flexibility to insurance plans by allowing its policyholders to select and pick a cover to boost coverage and different aspects of a plan based on their suitability.

Besides, the <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/add-on-covers/protection-of-ncb\">No Claim Bonus</a> or NCB benefit is only offered on the own-damage insurance cover within the policy.\r\n</p><p>The No Claim Bonus is a reward which is provided by the <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/companies\">bike insurance companies</a> to the policyholder for a claim-free year.
