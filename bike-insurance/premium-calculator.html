															calculation in a better way.

														<h2>How to Use a Two-Wheeler Insurance Premium Calculator?<br>
														</h2>
														<p>The technique of calculating the premium for two-wheeler
															insurance may vary from one insurer to another.
														</p>
														<p>Nonetheless, the type of premium calculators can be divided
															into two categories - one for new two-wheelers and the other
															for used two-wheelers. To calculate the premium quote for
															your two-wheeler insurance plan, all you need to do is to
															enter a bunch of important details of your two-wheeler and
															you are done.
														</p>
														<p>However, there are a few basic differences that affect the
															calculation of premium through the premium calculator for a
															new bike and used bike. The first element which brings the
															difference is the No Claim Bonus (NCB) earned by the
															policyholder. With the NCB amount, there is a scope of
															discount on the premium for a used bike insurance policy
															which is not available in the calculation of a premium for
															new bike insurance. The second factor that brings the
															difference is the age of the bike, where the new bike will
															have the higher Insured Declared Value (IDV) as compared to
															the used bike as the former would not have suffered as much
															depreciation as sustained by the latter. <br>
														</p>
														<p>Follow the steps given below to calculate two-wheeler
															insurance premium price online:</p>
														<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Select your bike’s model and make.
														</p>
														<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the registered location of
															your two-wheeler.
														</p>
														<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Select the year of purchase of your
															two-wheeler.
														</p>
														<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tell us if you claimed No-claim
															Bonus (NCB) in the preceding year.
														</p>
														<p>
															<strong>Step 5</strong>: Once the details are entered, the
															two-wheeler calculator will provide you with the premium
															amount for your two-wheeler insurance plan.<br>
														</p>

													Factors Which Determine Two-Wheeler Insurance Premium</h2>
												<div>
													<div>
														<p><strong></strong></p>
														<p>The factors determining two-wheeler insurance premium are
															discussed below:</p>
														<h3>1. Two-Wheeler Owner’s Age</h3>
														<p>As per the track records, it is assumed that two-wheeler
															riders below the age of 25 are more prone to get involved in
															an accident or other mishap than riders above the age of 25.
															Therefore, riders aged between 18 to 25 years have to pay a
															relatively higher premium for their two-wheeler insurance
															than others.</p>
														<h3>2. Fuel Type</h3>
														<p>Two-wheelers with CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) are required
															to pay a relatively higher premium for a bike insurance plan
															than the two-wheelers which run on petrol or diesel.</p>
														<h3>3. Geographical location</h3>
														<p>The insurers consider the location where the insured’s
															two-wheeler will be driven mostly, as a determining factor
															of the premium. For instance, riders in locations with
															higher traffic tendency and high risk such as metro cities
															are charged a relatively higher premium than those riding
															their two-wheelers in areas with lower traffic and low risk.
														</p>
														<h3>4. Insured Declared Value (IDV)</h3>
														<p>The maximum amount that an insurance provider pays to the
															insured’s two-wheeler owner in case of theft or constructive
															total loss is called the Insured Declared Value. The IDV may
															vary from one policyholder to another as per the brand,
															model, manufacturer’s selling price, RTO details etc. A high
															IDV will result in a high premium.</p>
														<h3>5. Cubic Capacity</h3>
														<p>Another factor that affects the own damage premium of a
															two-wheeler insurance plan is the vehicle’s cubic capacity.
															A relatively higher premium is charged for a two-wheeler
															with a greater cubic capacity than a lower one.</p>
														<h3>6. Other Factors</h3>
														<p>The premium of a two-wheeler insurance plan is also affected
															by the make, model and variant of the two-wheeler.</p>
														<p>Two-wheeler’s manufacturing year: The IDV values of a new
															two-wheeler is higher than the IDV of an old two-wheeler.
															Therefore, the premium for a new two-wheeler is higher than
															an old two-wheeler.</p>
														<h3>7. No Claim Bonus (NCB)</h3>
														<p><a href="add-on-covers/protection-of-ncb.html">No Claim
																Bonus</a> is the discount which a policyholder receives
															for not making even a single claim during the two-wheeler’s
															previous insurance policy.</p>
														<h3>8. ARAI Approved Anti-theft Devices</h3>
														<p>Vehicles that have ARAI (Automotive Research Association of
															India) approved anti-theft devices fitted are entitled to
															get 2.5% off on the premium of their insurance plan.</p>
														<h2>How To Reduce Two Wheeler Insurance Premium?</h2>
														<p>The following are the tips to lower the bike insurance
															premium:</p>
														<h3>1. Buy Insurance Online</h3>
														<p>It is economical to buy bike insurance online rather than
															purchasing it through an offline method. Different insurance
															providers give <a href="../index.html">insurance covers</a>
															at competitive rates online to allure customers. Also, the
															online purchase allows you to compare different plans to get
															the most affordable policy. </p>
														<h3>2. Do Not Make Small Claims</h3>
														<p>Making claims will make you lose No Claim Bonus (NCB), there
															try not to request insurance claim for small bike damages
															and pay for their repair bills on your own. It will make you
															earn a discount on your next year’s premium. </p>
														<h3>3. Installation of AAI-Approved Anti-Theft Devices</h3>
														<p><strong></strong>Several insurance companies offer discounts
															to policyholders who have anti-theft devices installed in
															their bikes which are certified by the Automotive Research
															Association of India (ARAI). Hence, installation of
															anti-theft devices can help you get insurance at a
															discounted price.</p>
														<h3>4. Opt for a Multi-Year Insurance Policy</h3>
														<p>If you choose to opt for a multi-year bike insurance plan for
															a period of up to 3 years rather than going for an annual
															bike insurance plan, then the insurance company may offer
															you a specific percentage of the discount. Moreover, with a
															long-term insurance plan, you can get rid of the hassles of
															going for yearly insurance plan renewal. Therefore, by doing
															so you can reduce the cost of your insurance premium.</p>
														<h3>5. Type of Bike</h3>
														<p>One of the primary factors affecting the premium cost is the
															type of bike selected by you. The cost of the premium for
															sports bikes and superbikes is generally higher as compared
															to the everyday commuter motorbike. With higher power and
															engine displacement, the cost of the premium for the bike
															insurance plan would also be higher. This is due to the fact
															that costly motorbikes would require greater maintenance in
															comparison to a general commuter bike. Therefore, it is
															recommended that you should select your bike carefully
															depending upon your requirements.</p>
														<h3>6. Add-On Covers Opted</h3>
														<p><a href="add-on-covers.html">Add-on covers</a> chosen by you
															add further to the premium cost. Hence, it is important to
															select only the add-on covers that are really needed and the
															rest should be avoided.</p>

A two-wheeler insurance premium amount is based on a number of factors like the insurance coverage, bike’s brand, model, variant, registration year and so on. The premium of the third party bike insurance is set as per the norms of IRDAI, whereas the premium of standalone own-damage and comprehensive bike insurance is given by the <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/companies\">two-wheeler insurance companies</a> and vary depending upon the specifications of the policyholder’s bike.\r\n</p><p>Here is an example to comprehend the bike insurance premium calculation in a better way.\r\n</p><p>Let’s assume, Mr. X wants to buy a bike insurance cover for his TVS Sportbike which has the following details:\r\n</p><ol>\r\n\t<li>Engine Capacity: 99.7 cc</li>\r\n\t<li>Variant: 100</li>\r\n\t<li>Registration City and Year: Noida and 2018</li>\r\n\t<li>Policy Tenure: 1 Year</li>\r\n\t<li>NCB: 20%</li>\r\n</ol><p>Bike Insurance Premium Calculator at InsuranceDekho, Mr. X can find the following policy quotes for the above-mentioned data:\r\n</p><table><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Two-Wheeler Insurance Plan</strong>\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Premium Amount</strong>\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>Third-Party Plan\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p> Rs. 752\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>Standalone Own-Damage Plan\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>Rs. 145\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>Comprehensive Plan\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<p>Rs. 891\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table><p><em>(Premium Rates As On Feb 1, 2021)</em>\r\n</p><h2>How to Use a Two-Wheeler Insurance Premium Calculator?<br></h2><p>The technique of calculating the premium for two-wheeler insurance may vary from one insurer to another.\r\n</p><p>Nonetheless, the type of premium calculators can be divided into two categories - one for new two-wheelers and the other for used two-wheelers. To calculate the premium quote for your two-wheeler insurance plan, all you need to do is to enter a bunch of important details of your two-wheeler and you are done.\r\n</p><p>However, there are a few basic differences that affect the calculation of premium through the premium calculator for a new bike and used bike. The first element which brings the difference is the No Claim Bonus (NCB) earned by the policyholder. With the NCB amount, there is a scope of discount on the premium for a used bike insurance policy which is not available in the calculation of a premium for new bike insurance. The second factor that brings the difference is the age of the bike, where the new bike will have the higher Insured Declared Value (IDV) as compared to the used bike as the former would not have suffered as much depreciation as sustained by the latter. <br>\r\n</p><p>Follow the steps given below to calculate two-wheeler insurance premium price online:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Select your bike’s model and make.\r\n</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the registered location of your two-wheeler.\r\n</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Select the year of purchase of your two-wheeler.\r\n</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>:  Tell us if you claimed No-claim Bonus (NCB) in the preceding year.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>Step 5</strong>: Once the details are entered, the two-wheeler calculator will provide you with the premium amount for your two-wheeler insurance plan.<br>\r\n</p><p><strong></strong>\r\n</p><h2>Two Wheeler Insurance Premium Calculator for New Bikes</h2><p><strong>Essential two-wheeler details to calculate the premium of an insurance plan for a new two-wheeler:</strong>\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>Name of manufacturer</li>\r\n\t<li>Year of manufacture</li>\r\n\t<li>Model of the two-wheeler</li>\r\n\t<li>A variant of the two-wheeler</li>\r\n\t<li>Registration state and city of the two-wheeler</li>\r\n</ul><p>The two-wheeler premium calculator will calculate the premium amount that you will have to pay for your two-wheeler insurance and will help you in choosing the right insurance.\r\n</p><h2>Two Wheeler Insurance Premium Calculator for Used Bikes</h2><p>Essential two-wheeler details to calculate the premium of an insurance plan for an old/used two-wheeler:\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>Make, model and variant of two-wheeler</li>\r\n\t<li>Fuel type</li>\r\n\t<li>Current two-wheeler insurance policy details (if any) </li>\r\n\t<li>Two-wheeler’s registration state and city</li>\r\n\t<li>No-claim Bonus (NCB) or past claim file reports and details (if any)</li>\r\n</ul><p>After entering the details, the two-wheeler premium calculator will provide the estimated amount of premium for your two-wheeler insurance plan.

Two-Wheeler Owner’s Age</h3><p>As per the track records, it is assumed that two-wheeler riders below the age of 25 are more prone to get involved in an accident or other mishap than riders above the age of 25. Therefore, riders aged between 18 to 25 years have to pay a relatively higher premium for their two-wheeler insurance than others.</p><h3>2. Fuel Type</h3><p>Two-wheelers with CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) are required to pay a relatively higher premium for a bike insurance plan than the two-wheelers which run on petrol or diesel.</p><h3>3. Geographical location</h3><p>The insurers consider the location where the insured’s two-wheeler will be driven mostly, as a determining factor of the premium. For instance, riders in locations with higher traffic tendency and high risk such as metro cities are charged a relatively higher premium than those riding their two-wheelers in areas with lower traffic and low risk.</p><h3>4. Insured Declared Value (IDV)</h3><p>The maximum amount that an insurance provider pays to the insured’s two-wheeler owner in case of theft or constructive total loss is called the Insured Declared Value. The IDV may vary from one policyholder to another as per the brand, model, manufacturer’s selling price, RTO details etc. A high IDV will result in a high premium.</p><h3>5. Cubic Capacity</h3><p>Another factor that affects the own damage premium of a two-wheeler insurance plan is the vehicle’s cubic capacity. A relatively higher premium is charged for a two-wheeler with a greater cubic capacity than a lower one.</p><h3>6. Other Factors</h3><p>The premium of a two-wheeler insurance plan is also affected by the make, model and variant of the two-wheeler.</p><p>Two-wheeler’s manufacturing year: The IDV values of a new two-wheeler is higher than the IDV of an old two-wheeler. Therefore, the premium for a new two-wheeler is higher than an old two-wheeler.</p><h3>7. No Claim Bonus (NCB)</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/add-on-covers/protection-of-ncb\">No Claim Bonus</a> is the discount which a policyholder receives for not making even a single claim during the two-wheeler’s previous insurance policy.</p><h3>8. ARAI Approved Anti-theft Devices</h3><p>Vehicles that have ARAI (Automotive Research Association of India) approved anti-theft devices fitted are entitled to get 2.5% off on the premium of their insurance plan.</p><h2>How To Reduce Two Wheeler Insurance Premium?</h2><p>The following are the tips to lower the bike insurance premium:</p><h3>1. Buy Insurance Online</h3><p>It is economical to buy bike insurance online rather than purchasing it through an offline method. Different insurance providers give <a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/\">insurance covers</a> at competitive rates online to allure customers. Also, the online purchase allows you to compare different plans to get the most affordable policy. </p><h3>2. Do Not Make Small Claims</h3><p>Making claims will make you lose No Claim Bonus (NCB), there try not to request insurance claim for small bike damages and pay for their repair bills on your own. It will make you earn a discount on your next year’s premium. </p><h3>3. Installation of AAI-Approved Anti-Theft Devices</h3><p><strong></strong>Several insurance companies offer discounts to policyholders who have anti-theft devices installed in their bikes which are certified by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI). Hence, installation of anti-theft devices can help you get insurance at a discounted price.</p><h3>4. Opt for a Multi-Year Insurance Policy</h3><p>If you choose to opt for a multi-year bike insurance plan for a period of up to 3 years rather than going for an annual bike insurance plan, then the insurance company may offer you a specific percentage of the discount. Moreover, with a long-term insurance plan, you can get rid of the hassles of going for yearly insurance plan renewal. Therefore, by doing so you can reduce the cost of your insurance premium.</p><h3>5. Type of Bike</h3><p>One of the primary factors affecting the premium cost is the type of bike selected by you. The cost of the premium for sports bikes and superbikes is generally higher as compared to the everyday commuter motorbike. With higher power and engine displacement, the cost of the premium for the bike insurance plan would also be higher. This is due to the fact that costly motorbikes would require greater maintenance in comparison to a general commuter bike. Therefore, it is recommended that you should select your bike carefully depending upon your requirements.</p><h3>6. Add-On Covers Opted</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.insurancedekho.com/bike-insurance/add-on-covers\">Add-on covers</a> chosen by you add further to the premium cost. Hence, it is important to select only the add-on covers that are really needed and the rest should be avoided.</p>" }, "addOns": {}, "relatedInsurerOption": {}, "breadcrumb": [{ "label": "Bike
