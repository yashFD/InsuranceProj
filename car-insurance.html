                                                    <p>Bumper to Bumper is an add-on cover designed to give holistic

                                                        cover, the

It is one of the important factors which affect the calculation of the premium as IDV is the amount which insurance companies pay the policyholder in the event of total loss of car. Higher IDV attracts a higher premium.</li>\r\n \r\n<li>Engine Cubic Capacity – The premium of a car insurance plan is also a function of the car’s engine cubic capacity. Greater the car’s cubic capacity, higher is the premium.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Age of the Car – With time the value of the four wheeler reduces due to depreciation. The normal wear and tear reduce the value of the car in the market due to which its insurance premium also reduces. Thus, greater the age, lower the premium.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Make, Model and Variant – The make, model and variant of the car affects the IDV of the car which eventually affects the car insurance premium. For different make, model and variants of the car, the different premium is applicable.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>RTO Location – Another important factor is the RTO location of the car. It gives the insurance company an idea about the density of traffic in the area/city where the car will be driven and thus the probability of road accidents and other mishaps.</li></ul>" }, { "title": "Can car insurance be transferred to the new owner at the purchase of a second hand four wheeler?", "defaultOpen": "off", "description": "<p>Yes, the four wheeler insurance can be transferred from the old owner to the new owner in case the sale of a second-hand car.

It is one of the important factors which affect the calculation of the premium as IDV is the amount which insurance companies pay the policyholder in the event of total loss of car. Higher IDV attracts a higher premium.</li>\r\n \r\n<li>Engine Cubic Capacity – The premium of a car insurance plan is also a function of the car’s engine cubic capacity. Greater the car’s cubic capacity, higher is the premium.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Age of the Car – With time the value of the four wheeler reduces due to depreciation. The normal wear and tear reduce the value of the car in the market due to which its insurance premium also reduces. Thus, greater the age, lower the premium.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Make, Model and Variant – The make, model and variant of the car affects the IDV of the car which eventually affects the car insurance premium. For different make, model and variants of the car, the different premium is applicable.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>RTO Location – Another important factor is the RTO location of the car.

Following are some factors which affect the premium for own-damage four wheeler insurance cover:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Insured Declared Value – The Insured Declared Value (IDV) is the current market value of the four wheeler. It is one of the important factors which affect the calculation of the premium as IDV is the amount which insurance companies pay the policyholder in the event of total loss of car. Higher IDV attracts a higher premium.</li>\r\n \r\n<li>Engine Cubic Capacity – The premium of a car insurance plan is also a function of the car’s engine cubic capacity. Greater the car’s cubic capacity, higher is the premium.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Age of the Car – With time the value of the four wheeler reduces due to depreciation. The normal wear and tear reduce the value of the car in the market due to which its insurance premium also reduces. Thus, greater the age, lower the premium.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Make, Model and Variant – The make, model and variant of the car affects the IDV of the car which eventually affects the car insurance premium. For different make, model and variants of the car, the different premium is applicable.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>RTO Location – Another important factor is the RTO location of the car. It gives the insurance company an idea about the density of traffic in the area/city where the car will be driven and thus the probability of road accidents and other mishaps.</li></ul>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can car insurance be transferred to the new owner at the purchase of a second hand four wheeler?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Yes, the four wheeler insurance can be transferred from the old owner to the new owner in case the sale of a second-hand car.
