<li><strong>Step 1</strong>
Intimate your insurance company about the accident or mishap.</li>

<li><strong>Step 2</strong>

The key benefits are as follows:</p><p><strong>1. Helps You Comply With Law</strong></p><p>A bike insurance helps you comply with the law. According to the Indian Motor Tariff, every bike owner is compulsorily required to hold at least a third-party bike insurance plan. Driving without a valid third-party bike insurance plan attracts a penalty of Rs. 2,000 and/or imprisonment of up to 3 months.</p><p><strong>2. Protection Against Third-Party Liabilities</strong></p><p>A bike insurance plan covers the financial liabilities that you may incur towards a third-party like bodily injuries, disability, death and property damage. The coverage for property damage is limited up to Rs. 1 Lakh.</p><p><strong>3. Protection Against Own-Damages</strong></p><p>A bike insurance plan covers the own-damage expenses of your bike which may incur due to accidents, fire, theft, natural and man-made disasters, etc. Such coverage is provided under standalone own-damage plans and comprehensive bike insurance plans.</p><p><strong>4. Coverage Against Theft</strong></p><p>A two-wheeler insurance plan gives you coverage even if your bike/two wheeler gets stolen. In such cases, your insurer will provide you with your bike’s Insured Declared Value (IDV) which will be equal to the market price of your bike at the time of policy purchase.</p><p><strong>5. Personal Accident Cover</strong></p><p>You can include a personal accident cover of up to Rs. 15 Lakh in your bike insurance plan to cover bodily injuries, disability or death of the bike insurance policyholder.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=" "><div class="ArticleCarousal dividerborder margin60"><div class="gsc_container"><div class="gsc_row"><div class="gsc_col-xs-12

Generally, the contract between insured and insurer is of a year which should be renewed every year.</p>"},{"title":"Why should I purchase a bike insurance policy?","defaultOpen":"off","description":"<p>No matter which bike you own, you need to comply with some laws to ride it. To carry a bike insurance policy is the most important rule to drive a bike as you need to adhere to the legal requirement of carrying at least a third party cover. Besides this, a bike insurance policy also covers your financial liabilities which you may incur towards a third party or own damages sustained by your bike due to an accident or any unfortunate incident.</p>"},{"title":"What are the different types of bike insurance plan?","defaultOpen":"off","description":"<p>There are three types of bike insurance plans such as third party bike insurance plan, standalone own damage bike insurance plan, and comprehensive bike insurance plan.</p>"},{"title":"What is the premium of different bike insurance plans?","defaultOpen":"off","description":"<p>The cost of the premium for different bike insurance plans are different. When it comes to the third party policy, its premium is set by the IRDAI which varies as per the bike’s engine capacity. But, the premium for own-damage and comprehensive plans varies from bike to bike due to various factors like bike’s make, model, and variant, engine capacity, fuel type, etc.</p>"},{"title":"What if my bike insurance policy gets expired?","defaultOpen":"off","description":"<p>Every two-wheeler insurance policy has a date of expiry before which you should renew it to continue to avail it. However, if you fail to renew the policy on time, you still can renew it within the 90 days grace period from the expiry date, but it can not be renewed after that and you will have to buy a new policy in that case.</p>"},{"title":"How to find my bike insurance policy number?","defaultOpen":"off","description":"<p>Bike insurance policy number is a unique number which is of 8 to 10 digits provided by the insurance company. It is generally printed on the insurance card that is issued by the insurance providers. You can also find it by entering your registered mobile number on the website of your insurer.</p>"},{"title":"Which is the best bike insurance company in India?","defaultOpen":"off","description":"<p>There are numerous parameters to select an insurance company to insure your bike. The Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR) is one of the most important parameters to gauge the efficiency of an insurance provider. The CSR is a ratio of claims settled by a bike insurance company out of the total claims received by the insurer during the financial year. In the financial year 2019-20, the companies with the highest claim settlement ratio are IFFCO Tokio General Insurance (95.30%), Royal Sundaram General Insurance (92.66%), and Oriental Insurance Company (91.76%) with which the IFFCO Tokio can be considered the best company in India for the year 2021.</p>"},{"title":"Is it compulsory to own a bike insurance in India?","defaultOpen":"off","description":"<p>Yes, according to the Indian Motor Tariff, every bike owner is required to carry at least a third party bike insurance plan.</p>"},{"title":"Can a bike owner purchase two bike insurance for the same bike?","defaultOpen":"off","description":"<p>No, a bike owner can not buy two insurance plans for the same bike.

The policy transfer must be completed within 14 days from the purchase date of the bike.</p>"},{"title":"What are the factors that determine the premium of a bike insurance policy?","defaultOpen":"off","description":"<p>The third party policy premium of your bike is fixed by the IRDAI, while the standalone own-damage and comprehensive policy premium varies from insurer to insurer based on several factors which are as follow:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Type of Coverage – Different policies cost different premium amounts such as third party policy, own-damage policy, and comprehensive policy.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Bike Make, Model and Variant – The brand, model, and variant of the bike affects the premium as per their cost. The high-end bikes have higher premiums when compared to standard bikes.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Bike Modifications – Modifications in a bike may improve its looks and performance, but to cover those modifications and accessories your insurance premium will also increase.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Add-on Covers – Insurers offer different add-on covers for bike insurance plan. To add them in your policy, you will have to pay an additional premium that increases the policy premium.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Anti-Theft Devices - Anti-theft devices lessen the probability of bike theft which reduces the risk for the insurers too due to which they reward the insured with a lower premium.</li></ul>"},{"title":"How to raise a bike insurance claim online?","defaultOpen":"off","description":"<p>You can raise a bike insurance claim online with the below-given steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 1: Raise a claim at your insurer’s website or mobile app</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 2: You will get a claim registration number from your insurer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3: Insurer will send a surveyor to examine the damage extent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 4: Take your damaged bike to a garage to get repaired of your choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 5: The claim will be settled by your insurer on the basis of the chosen garage.</p>"}]},"topNews":{"tabList":[{"title":"Latest","items":[{"title":"Key Protect Add-on in Two-Wheeler Insurance Policy","content":"Read this article to know about key protection add-ons in two-wheeler insurance.","thumbnail_image":"https://staticimg.insurancedekho.com/uploads/news/image/Untitled-1_0010_Key_Protect_Add-on_in_Two-Wheeler_Insurance_Policy_1633363098-thumb.jpg","publish_date":"2021-10-08T05:30:00.000Z","author_name":"InsuranceDekho","slug":"/bike-insurance/news/key-protect-add-on-in-two-wheeler-insurance-policy.htm","image_alt":"Key Protect Add-on in Two-Wheeler Insurance Policy"},{"title":"Top bike insurance add-on covers offered by SBI General Insurance","content":"Read this article to know about top bike insurance add-on covers offered by SBI General Insurance.","thumbnail_image":"https://staticimg.insurancedekho.com/uploads/news/image/Untitled-1_0001_Top_bike_insurance_add-on_covers_offered_by_SBI_General_Insurance_1633362870-thumb.jpg","publish_date":"2021-10-08T04:30:00.000Z","author_name":"InsuranceDekho","slug":"/bike-insurance/news/top-bike-insurance-add-on-covers-offered-by-sbi-general-insurance.htm","image_alt":"Top bike insurance add-on covers offered by SBI General Insurance"},{"title":"How Raheja QBE Insurance helps You Protect Your Bike?","content":"Raheja QBE General Insurance is a fast-growing insurance provider.
